<h2>An overview of Martial Arts</h2>



<h2>Introduction</h2>	

<p align="justify">Throughout this article, I will explain to you what martial arts are. I will then go on to teach you about some of the different types and the disciplines involved in these incredible methods of combat. Martial Arts are taught for Defence only. It is a discipline that is to be respected and must never be abused.The term ‘martial arts doesn’t actually have roots in East Asia, but it does in Europe. The term martial art means ‘art of mars’. Mars is the roman god of war. 
There are different types of martial arts and they have different strategies involved with them. Different strategies are more beneficial for different circumstances and goals. For an example, if you are looking to learn how to grapple and how to fight on the ground; focussing on locks and chokeholds, then you should probably consider Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ).

<h2>Different styles of Martial Arts </h2>

<h2>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)-</h2>

<p align="justify">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a Brazilian martial art that specializes in grappling, body locks and ground work. It involves putting your opponent on the ground and using locks and chokeholds to maintain the dominant position. BJJ was developed around 1920, by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão jr., George, and Hélio Gracie after Carlos was taught traditional Kodokan Judo in 1917. BJJ is mainly about fighting on the ground and staying there and locking your opponent so they cannot move or attack you.</p align="justify">

<h3>Judo-</h3>

<p align="justify">Judo is a Japanese martial art that was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano. The origins of judo are based around Jiu Jitsu. Like Jiu Jitsu, the main idea of judo is to ground your opponent and lock them in a choke hold to maintain the upper hand throughout the fight. The word judo means ‘gentle way’. The main aim of judo is competition where you have to score points by throwing or pinning your opponent to the ground. A judo practitioner is called a "judoka", and the judo uniform is called "judogi". Judo has also influenced other styles of combat, like ‘MMA’, ‘shoot wrestling’ and ‘submission wrestling’ because of the main idea of grounding your opponent.</p align="justify">

<p align="justify">Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that uses dance, music and acrobatics to create a style of combat. It was first practised in the 16th century by enslaved Africans in Brazil. The art usually consists of kicking and dodging. It uses more fluent and graceful movements instead of rigid stances and set movements in other martial arts. A practitioner of capoeira is called a ‘capoeirista’. Interestingly, when the enslaved Africans were practicing capoeira, the dance and the music was used to disguise the fact that they were practicing fighting otherwise it would have been prohibited. After slavery was abolished in Brazil, capoeira was made illegal at the end of the 19th century. By the 1920’s authorities declared capoeira legal again.  Later on, martial artists began to use the capoeira techniques in their practises and it was taught. Capoeira requires one of the highest levels of core strength in order to complete the moves. Capoeira is probably one of the most flexible martial arts. Because of the origin of capoeira, it does not really have a ranking system but your rank depends on your skill level and your amount of experience in doing it. Capoeira can use weapons because of its origins. Weapons such as knives and blades are sometimes used during capoeira for slashing and stabbing, though what happened to the martial arts?</p align="justify">

<p align="justify">In capoeira, all of the movements and techniques revolve around a few movements (when performed together) are called ginga. It involves moving side to side whilst being bent forward and moving your legs back; switching places each time; as seen in the gif image below.</p align="justify">

Kickboxing originated from japan in the 1960’s. Later on, in the 1970’s American kickboxing began and became important in September 1974.
